# Prototype Bot

Do you have someone that you want to send random pictures from danbooru's wide collection of anime pictures? or you just want to serve your server randomized pictures. well this the right bot code blueprint for you. 

This bot function as a requestor to danbooru(or any of its variation) to fetch a random picture and create and send the link as a message.

If you are planning to make a bot that needs to fetch random pictures, feel free to use this as a guide to implement it(or fork and extend this bot capability if you like :) )

The main reason of the creation of this bot is for me to explore on bot creation using discord.js and just to serve my friends some random anime picture they like from danbooru.
